todo:
I have the first part working, in that the multi-symbol version is the same as the two symbol version, when run on two symbols
It also works on a larger SNP set, when there are a few symbols, which is great

The next steps are to make it more efficient, figure out a better storage mechanism
Then if that makes sense, port it to C++ for some more tests!
